# ERC20 Token and Vault System

This repository contains an implementation of an ERC20 token and a secure vault system for managing the tokens.

## ERC20 Token

The ERC20 token is a standard interface for fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. It provides functionalities such as transferring tokens, querying the balance of tokens for an address, approving spending tokens on behalf of another address, etc.

### Features

- Implements the ERC20 standard interface.
- Supports functionalities like transfer, transferFrom, approve, allowance, and balanceOf.
- Uses Solidity for smart contract development.

### Usage

To use the ERC20 token:

1. Deploy the ERC20 smart contract on an Ethereum-compatible blockchain network.
2. Interact with the deployed contract using Ethereum wallets or smart contracts.
3. Customize the token name, symbol, decimals, and initial token supply as needed.

## Vault System

The vault system provides a secure way to manage ERC20 tokens by allowing users to deposit, withdraw, and transfer tokens with added security measures.

### Features

- Users can deposit ERC20 tokens into their vault.
- Users can withdraw tokens from their vault.
- Supports transferring tokens between vaults securely.
- Implements access controls to ensure only authorized users can interact with the vaults.

### Usage

To use the vault system:

1. Deploy the Vault smart contract on an Ethereum-compatible blockchain network.
2. Configure access controls to define authorized users and their permissions.
3. Users can interact with their vaults by depositing, withdrawing, and transferring tokens securely.
4. Administrators can manage access controls and monitor vault activities.

## Getting Started

To get started with using the ERC20 token and vault system:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Review the smart contract code in the `contracts/` directory.
3. Deploy the smart contracts to an Ethereum-compatible blockchain network.
4. Interact with the deployed contracts using Ethereum wallets or smart contracts.
5. Customize the contracts according to your requirements.
